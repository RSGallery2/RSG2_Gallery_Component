Greeting Version 2016.10.03
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the portal/forum of RSGallery2</h2>
<p>RSGallery2 is one of several gallery extensions/components for the well known CMS Joomla! RSGallery is around since the Mambo days and is orginally developed by Ronald Smit. Since then, RSGallery has evolved into what it is nowadays. Although always developing, RSGallery2 is produced with the user in mind first. 
<p><strong>Ultimate Simplicity</strong>
<br />
The simplest gallery you can ever think of... You only need a few clicks to install it through Joomla's install manager. A few more to create your own galleries. Your website with a gallery is ready to go within a couple of minutes, and simple to customise to reflect YOU.</p>
