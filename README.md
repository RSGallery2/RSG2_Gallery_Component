About RSGallery2

RSGallery2 is released by the GPL licence and will be free to use (as in free beer). If you like the project and want to give something back, please help out other users in the forums and share your code.

RSGallery2 is a project run by volunteers. People who just love Joomla and this gallery component. So RSGallery2 needs you! How? By reporting bugs and problems in the forum, by answering questions of other users on the forum, by submitting fixes for bugs, by writing documentation... where? On www.rsgallery2.nl!
