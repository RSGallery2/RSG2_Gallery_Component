# RSGallery2_Component
RSGallery2 is one of several gallery extensions/components for the well known CMS Joomla!

<hr>

# This branch b_j_3_10_compatibility_layer:

The code attempts to pave the way to more or less smooth trnaisition to joomla!4x version

**!!! Attention: Breaking changes !!!**

Rsgallery2 lived for a long time on jquery and mootools. Especially the display functions like slideshows are outdated and must be replaced completely. This can't be done without some changes by the user.

* templates
* slideshows
* user galleries -> not supported (? for a while)
* .
* .
* .
*

On the other side this enables us to initiate major improvements with small changes which may later be coded as time allows us. There is already a little bit of documantation retrieved by the parallel project "RSGallery2_J4" which is a test project for j!4x direct. Sometime in the future they will merge.

## History
Incomplete (Gathered or imagined by me, Thomas Finnern)

The project started in the mambo days and got really big in J!1.5. Due to reasons unknown the access to the site www.rsgallery2.net got lost and it was not accessible for some time. Mirjam and "locutusweb" arranged for a restart on rsgallery2.nl but the connection to the former developers and their interest was gone.

Mirjam got the version running under J!2.5 and did a great Job supporting user on the forum. While starting to upgrade for J!3x she got a baby and does only user maintenance now. I finished her task. (First rsgallery2 version for J!3.x 16.04.2015)

In Oct. 2016 the forum was moved to forum.rsgallery2.org and a the web page rsgallery.org was created.
It is planned that from January 2018 on the backend runs completely on ¨new¨ software and is faster.

...   To be continued ;-)
